To troubleshoot Luna Streaming, look at these potential issues:

* xref:troubleshooting.adoc#bastionpod[**Using the Bastion Pod**]

[#checkquotas]
== Check quotas

In some cases, pods can become unhealthy. The root cause might be an insufficient quota. You can check quotas in the cloud provider's user interface. +
For example, in the Google Cloud (GCP) console, check for any unhealthy pods in your GKE project. Then in the *IAM & Admin* section of the GCP console, navigate to *Quotas*. Look for any reported issues with backend services:

From the GCP Console *Quotas* display:

. Select the row for the service name that is reporting a quota issue.
. Select **All Quotas** from the *Details* column.
. Check the box for the affected quota, and select **Edit Quota**. 
+
The dialog indicates: "Enter a new quota limit. Your request will be sent to your service provider for approval." 

. Examine the displayed current value and set a new value. 
. Enter a brief request description, and select **Next**.
. Verify your contact information, and select **Submit Request**.

In the following example, the Backend services quota is set to '5'. We're changing it to '50'. For the K8ssandra deployments, such as Stargate, cass-operator, Reaper, and Medusa, `10` might be a sufficient quota.

[#containerspending]
== Containers in *Pending* state 

If your pods are stuck in a *Pending* state after installation or your cloud provider is warning you about *Unschedulable Pods*, there are a few ways to work through this:

* If some of your pods start, but others like `pulsar-adminconsole` and `pulsar-grafana` are left in an *Unschedulable* state, you might need to add CPUs to your existing nodes or an additional node pool. Luna Streaming requires more resources than Apache Pulsar. 

* To examine a specific pod, use `kubectl describe`. For example, if your `pulsar-bookkeeper-0` pod is not scheduling, use `kubectl describe pods/pulsar-bookkeeper-0` to view detailed output on the pod's state, dependencies, and events. 

* To view log output for a specific pod, use `kubectl logs`. Continuing with the `pulsar-bookkeeper-0` example, to get logs for this pod use `kubectl logs pulsar-bookkeeper-0`. If this pod spans multiple containers, add the flag `--all-containers=true`. 

[#bastionpod]
== Bastion pod

The bastion pod deploys with Luna Streaming and allows a user to execute administrative commands in a bash shell of the cluster. This can be a helpful troubleshooting tool for testing the health of your cluster. 

=== Access bastion pod

To use the bastion pod after installation, access the shell of the bastion pod. Let's use the namespace `default`:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n default exec $(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=pulsar,component=bastion" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -it -- bash
----

Your bash shell will then show that you are in your bastion pod: 

[source,bash]
----
pulsar@pulsar-bastion-78d4cd74ff-ctvvh:/pulsar$
----

=== Test bastion pod

Ensure your bastion pod sees your cluster with `pulsar admin namespaces list public`. It should return a list of your public namespaces:

[source,bash]
----
"public/default"
"public/functions"
----

If you get `bash: admin: command not found`, move into the `bin` directory with `cd bin`. You might need to append your command with `./`, for example `./pulsar-admin get pods`.
If the shell finds no resources, you might not have any public namespaces. Create a public namespace with `pulsar-admin namespaces create public/default`. 

=== Publish a message

To test your Pulsar cluster with the bastion pod, produce a message with `pulsar-client` through the bastion pod shell: 

`pulsar-client produce my-test-topic --messages "hello-pulsar"`

You should receive a confirmation the message was produced:

`00:16:37.970 [main] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.client.cli.PulsarClientTool - 1 messages successfully produced`

This means your Pulsar cluster is functional. If the message isn't produced, double-check your message syntax.

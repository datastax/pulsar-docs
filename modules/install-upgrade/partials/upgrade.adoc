* Upgrading to 3.1 Luna Streaming should only be done from 2.10 Luna Streaming.

* Upgrade is fully supported for all the components (connectors included).

* If you're upgrading Pulsar SQL from 2.11 or earlier, you should copy config files from conf/presto to trino/conf.
If you're downgrading Pulsar SQL to 2.11 or earlier from newer versions, do the vice-versa.

* Prometheus client version has been changed from 0.5.0 to 0.16.0. Metric type UNTYPED is renamed to UNKNOWN.
The metrics have been renamed because OpenMetrics's counter name needs a _total suffix.
E.g `pulsar_expired_token_count` changed to `pulsar_expired_token_total`.
** Reference PR - https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/13785[Bump prometheus client version #13785]

* Downgrade is not supported for Bookies, rest all components support downgrade.
**  Pulsar 3.1 uses RocksDB 7.x which writes in a format that is not compatible with RocksDB 6.x
which is used by LunaStreaming 2.10 via Bookkeeper 4.14.

= Multi-region georeplication
This page contains sizing and configuration information for a single VM-based production cluster. +
Pulsar clusters can be configured to replicate data across multiple regions to maximize availability.
This replication can be *synchronous* or *asynchronous* and implemented *with* or *without* a global Zookeeper (configuration store).

We apply our sizing methodology with the following assumptions: +

* Replication will be *asynchronous* and *not* use a global Zookeeper.
* We will replicate *all topics* across two regions.
* We will assume the same TTL and retention policies as the initial Pulsar cluster (the cluster being replicated from).

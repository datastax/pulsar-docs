= Multi-region georeplication
Pulsar clusters can be configured to replicate data across multiple regions to maximize availability.
This replication can be *synchronous* or *asynchronous* and implemented *with* or *without* a global Zookeeper (configuration store).
This example is *asynchronous* and does *not* use a global Zookeeper.

= Pulsar VM sandbox clusters

This page sizes the minimum, baseline resources for a Pulsar cluster on VM.
Size your cluster through development, test, and finally to production environments starting with the recommended counts below.

The methodology and assumptions driving these recommendations are described in xref:production-cluster-sizing.adoc[].

== Development cluster
.Development cluster sizing
[cols=4*,options=header]

|(combined) Zookeeper, Broker, and Bookie
|3
|1 node per AZ +
In the simplest case, Pulsar can run on only 1 server host as a standalone mode.

Even if the Pulsar function is needed, it runs as part of the brokers. No dedicated function worker node is needed.

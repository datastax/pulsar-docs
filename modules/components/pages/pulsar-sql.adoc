Pulsar SQL allows enterprises to query Apache Pulsar topic data with SQL.
This is a powerful feature for an Enterprise, and SQL is a language they're likely familiar with.
Stream processing, real-time analytics, and highly customized dashboards are just a few of the possibilities.
Pulsar offers a pre-made plugin for Trino that is included in its distribution.
Additionally, Pulsar has built-in options to create Trino workers and automatically configure the communications between Pulsar’s ledger and Trino.

In this guide, we will use the DataStax Pulsar Helm Chart to install a Pulsar cluster with Pulsar SQL.
The Trino coordinator and desired number of workers will be created directly in the cluster.

== Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites in place to complete this guide:

* Pulsar CLI
* https://trino.io/docs/current/client/cli.html[Trino CLI^]{external-link-icon} (this example version 443)
* https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm 3 CLI^]{external-link-icon} (this example uses version 3.8.0)
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Kubectl CLI^]{external-link-icon} (this example uses version 1.23.4)
* Enough access to a K8s cluster to create a namespace, deployments, and pods

[IMPORTANT]
====
PrestoDB has been replaced by Trino, and Apache Pulsar is using Trino’s version.
The Trino CLI uses the "X-TRINO-USER" header for authentications.
====

== Install Luna Streaming Helm chart

include::partial$install-helm.adoc[]

== Forward service port

We need to interact with services in the K8s cluster, so let’s map a few ports to those services.
There’s no need to forward Pulsar’s messaging service ports.

include::partial$port-forward-sql.adoc[]

include::partial$port-forward-web-service.adoc[]

== Confirm Trino is available

. In a browser, navigate to \http://localhost:8081. +
You will be greeted by Trino’s login.
+

. There is no authentication enabled, so input whatever user name you prefer and select “Log In”. +
You will be greeted by a blank dashboard.
This confirms Trino is up and running.

[#create-topic]
== Fill a topic with the data-generator source

In this example, we will use the “data-generator” source connector to create a topic and add sample data simultaneously.
The minimalist Helm chart values use the https://github.com/datastax/release-notes/blob/master/Luna_Streaming_3.1_Release_Notes.md#lunastreaming-all-distribution[datastax/lunastreaming-all^]{external-link-icon} image, which includes all supported Pulsar connectors. +
This example uses the “public” tenant and “default” namespace.
These are created by default in Pulsar, but you can use whatever tenant and namespace you are comfortable with.

. Download the minimalist Pulsar client.
This "client.conf" assumes the port forwarding addresses we will perform in the next step.
+
[source,shell]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datastaxdevs/luna-streaming-examples/main/client.conf
----

. Set the client environment variable. Replace the value with the absolute path to the "client.conf" you just downloaded.
+
[source,shell]
----
# the client conf path must be an absolute path to the downloaded conf file
export PULSAR_CLIENT_CONF=<REPLACE_WITH /path/to/client.conf>
----

. Navigate to the Pulsar home folder and run the following command.
The CLI will use the environment variable's value as configuration for interacting with the Pulsar cluster.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/pulsar-admin sources create --name generator --destination-topic-name public/default/mytopic --source-type data-generator
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The topic name will become a table name in Trino, so SQL naming rules apply.

Names can contain only alphanumeric characters and must begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore (_).
====

. Confirm the topic was created.

[source,shell]
----
./bin/pulsar-admin topics list public/default
----

You should get an output of:

[source,shell]
----
persistent://public/default/mytopic
----

== Interact with the topic data

And now, the moment of truth...

. Open a Trino shell session using the Trino CLI.
The server’s port number should match the forwarded port number from the previous step.
The user can match the name you used to login earlier in this guide, but doesn’t have to.
+
[source,shell]
----
./trino --user test --server localhost:8081
----

. Once inside the shell, let’s have a look around. List the catalogs Trino has loaded.
+
[source,shell]
----
trino> show catalogs;
----
You should get an output of:
+
[source,shell]
----
 Catalog
---------
 pulsar
 system
(2 rows)

Query 20230103_163242_00000_zvk84, FINISHED, 2 nodes
----
Notice the similarities between your Pulsar tenant/namespaces and Trino’s output.
. List the tables within the `pulsar.”public/default”` catalog/schema. +
+
[source,shell]
----
trino> show tables in pulsar."public/default";
----
You should get an output of:
+
[source,shell]
----
  Table
---------
 mytopic
(1 row)

Query 20230103_163355_00001_zvk84, FINISHED, 2 nodes
----
Hey trino{emoji-tada}!
There’s our topic that was created from the data-generator source connector <<create-topic,earlier in this guide>>!

. Query the table to see the first 10 rows of data.
+
[source,sql]
----
trino> select * from pulsar."public/default".mytopic limit 10;
----
The output should be the 10 messages that were added to the Pulsar topic previously.

.. If you prefer, you can query your table with the Trino client REST API.
The response will include a “nextUri” value.
Follow that link to see the results.
+
[source,]
----
POST http://localhost:8081/v1/statement  HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json
X-Trino-User: test

select * from pulsar."public/default".mytopic limit 10
----

. Exit the trino shell.
+
[source,shell]
----
trino> exit
----

You have successfully interacted with a Pulsar Cluster via SQL. Awesome!{emoji-rocket}

Want to put your new learnings to the test? Try using the Trino plugin in https://redash.io/data-sources/presto[Redash^]{external-link-icon} or https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/trino/[Superset^]{external-link-icon} to create useful dashboards.

[#schema-quotes]
=== Sidebar: Why are there quotes around the schema name?
You might wonder why there are quotes (“”) around the schema name.
This is a result of mapping Trino primitives to Pulsar’s primitives.

Trino has catalogs, schemas, and tables.
Pulsar has tenants, namespaces, and topics.
The Pulsar Trino plugin assumes the catalog name which leaves schema and table, so the tenant and namespace are combined with a forward slash delimited string. Trino has to see that combination as a single string, which means it needs to be wrapped in quotes.

== Connect with JDBC

Bonus time!
This example queries messages from a Java app using the Trino JDBC client.
You’ll need the Java runtime to run the example.

. Create a file named “TrinoExample.java” with the following contents.
Remember to update the JDBC connection with the correct values for your environment.
+
[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datastaxdevs/luna-streaming-examples/main/pulsar-sql/TrinoExample.java[]
----
. Build the Java class.
+
[source,shell]
----
javac TrinoExample.java
----
. Download the https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/trino/trino-jdbc/443/trino-jdbc-443.jar[version 443 Trino JDBC driver^]{external-link-icon} to the same folder as the Java class.

. Run the client and observe the output.
`-cp` tells Java to use the downloaded trino-jdbc jar in your classpath to connect.
+
[source,shell]
----
java -cp .:trino-jdbc-443.jar TrinoExample
----

You should get an output of:
[source,shell]
----

Starlight for RabbitMQ brings native https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ^]{external-link-icon} protocol support to https://pulsar.apache.org/[Apache Pulsar™^]{external-link-icon} by introducing a RabbitMQ protocol handler on Pulsar brokers or Pulsar proxies.
By adding the Starlight for RabbitMQ protocol handler to your Pulsar cluster, you can migrate your existing RabbitMQ applications and services to Pulsar without modifying the code.

== Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites in place to complete this guide:

* https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm 3 CLI^]{external-link-icon} (we used version 3.8.0)
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Kubectl CLI^]{external-link-icon} (we used version 1.23.4)
* Python (we used version 3.8.10)
* Enough access to a K8s cluster to create a namespace, deployments, and pods

== Install Luna Streaming helm chart

include::partial$install-helm.adoc[]

== Forward service port

We will need to interact with a few of the services in the K8s cluster. Let’s map a few ports to those services.

== Produce a message with the RabbitMQ Python client

If you hadn't noticed, we never opened the Pulsar binary port to accept new messages.
Only the admin port and the RabbitMQ port are open.
To further demonstrate how native Starlight for RabbitMQ is, we will use the Pika RabbitMQ Python library to produce and consume messages from Pulsar.

Save the following Python script to a safe place as `test-queue.py`.
The script assumes you have opened the localhost:5672 port.

[source,python]
----
include::{luna-streaming-examples-repo}/starlight-for-rabbitmq/test-queue.py[]
----

Open a terminal and return to the safe place where you saved the Python script.
Run the following command to execute the Python program.

[source,shell]
----
python ./test-queue.py
----

The output should look like the following.

[souce,shell]
----
created test-queue queue
published message test
received message: test
deleted test-queue queue
----

== Summary

Wow! That was easy. +
The Luna Helm chart deployed Starlight for RabbitMQ on the Pulsar proxy and opened the correct port.
Your application will now "talk" to Pulsar as if it were a real RabbitMQ host.

[#getting-started]
== Getting Started in Pulsar Admin Console

In the *Luna Streaming Pulsar Admin Console*, you can use Pulsar clients to send and receive pub/sub messages.

If you installed the Admin console with the xref:quickstart-helm-installs.adoc[DataStax Helm chart], access the Admin console via the `pulsar-adminconsole` external load balancer endpoint in your cloud provider:

Log in with username `admin`. 

If you're running a xref:quickstart-server-installs.adoc[server or VM] deployment, see xref:admin-console-vm.adoc[Admin Console on Server/VM] for instructions on deploying and accessing the Admin console.

[#features]
== Pulsar Admin Console features

To try out your service, use the built-in WebSocket test clients on the Pulsar Admin Console's *Test Clients* page. 

To see currently available namespaces, go to *Namespaces*, or select the button in the upper right corner.

Messages published to namespaces are automatically replicated to all node(s) in the cluster.

For interactive code samples, go to *Code Samples*. 

[#send-receive]
== Sending and receiving Pulsar messages

Go to the Pulsar Admin Console's **Test Clients** page. The quickest way to try your service is to use the test clients and send messages from one client to the other. 

In the WebSocket Test Client 1 section, click **Connect**. This action creates a connection from the Pulsar Admin Console that's running in your browser to the Pulsar instance on your server.

Scroll down to the Consume tab. In this simple example, which verifies that the service is running properly, add a `hello world` message and click Send. Example:

image::test-message.png[Send a message using a test client]

In doing so, you published a message to your server, and in the Test Client you're listening to your own topic. +

Your client is working with the Pulsar server. 

[#create-topics]
== Create new topics and tenants

By default, topics are automatically created when you first publish or subscribe. To manually create a topic or to create a partitioned topic, go to *Topics*.

The first part of a full topic name is your tenant name, followed by the namespace, and then the topic name, as below: +

`public/namespace/my-topic`

Select your current tenant using the drop-down at the top right of the Topics page. 

To create a new tenant, go to *Tenants*.

To see detailed information about your topics, go to *Topics*.

[#code-samples]
== Code samples

On the Pulsar Admin Console's *Code Samples* page, there are examples for Java, Python, Golang, Node.js, WebSocket, and HTTP clients. +
Each example shows Producer, Consumer, and Reader code, plus language-specific examples of setting project properties and dependencies. +
For example, selecting Java will show you how to connect your Java project to Pulsar by modifying your Maven's `pom.xml` file.

[#connect-to-pulsar]
== Connecting to Pulsar

This section describes how to connect Pulsar components to the Admin console. 

=== Creating and showing credentials

When connecting clients, you'll need to provide your connect token to identify your account. In the Pulsar APIs, you specify the token when creating the client object. The token is your password to your account, so keep it safe. +

The code samples automatically add your client token as part of the source code for convenience. However, a more secure practice would be to read the token from an environment variable or a file. +

In the Admin console's *Credentials* page, select **Create New token** and follow the instructions. +

If you previously created a token, use the Credentials page to get its value.

=== Connecting Clients

To connect using the Pulsar binary protocol, use the following URL format with port 6651:

`pulsar+ssl://<dns-name>:6651`

For example, for an installed node with a DNS name ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:

`pulsar+ssl://ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:6651`

=== Connect with WebSocket API

To connect using the WebSocket API, use the following URL format with port 8001:

`wss://<dns-name>:8001`

For example:

`wss://ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:8001`

=== Connect with HTTPS

To connect using HTTP, use the following URL format with port 8085:

`https://<dns-name>:8085`

For example:

`https://ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:8085`

=== Connect to Pulsar admin API

To connect to the admin API, use the following URL format with port 8443:

`https://<dns-name>:8443`

For example, give a DNS name of ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:

`https://ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:8443`

You can list all the tenants like this, for example:

`pulsar-admin --admin-url https://ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:8443`

Or if you have authentication enabled, like this:

[source,bash]
----
pulsar-admin --admin-url https://ip-10-101-32-250.srv101.dsinternal.org:8443 \
    --auth-plugin org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationToken \
    --auth-params file:///token.jwt
----

You can get the token from the Pulsar Admin Console's *Credentials* page.

Alternatively, you can save the URL authentication parameters in your `client.conf` file.

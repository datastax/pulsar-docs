* https://github.com/datastax/burnell[https://github.com/datastax/burnell, window=_blank] : This is a utility for Pulsar that provides various functions, such as key initialization for authentication, and JWT token creation API.

== Installation

=== Is there a prerequisite version of Java needed for the DataStax Luna Streaming installation?

The DataStax Luna Streaming distribution is designed for Java 11. However, because the product releases Docker images, you do not need to install Java (8 or 11) in advance. Java 11 is bundled in the Docker image.

=== What are the install options for DataStax Luna Streaming?

* Use the provided Helm Chart to install DataStax Luna Streaming in an existing Kubernetes cluster on your laptop or hosted by a cloud provider.
* Use the tarball provided at https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/standalone/

=== How do I install DataStax Luna Streaming in my Kubernetes cluster?

Follow the full instructions in xref:quickstart-helm-installs.adoc[Quick Start for Helm Chart installs].

=== How do I install DataStax Luna Streaming on my server or VM?

Follow the full instructions in xref:quickstart-server-installs.adoc[Quick Start for Server/VM installs].

== How do I start the DataStax Luna Streaming Admin Console?

See the following topics:

* If you installed Luna Streaming via the Helm Chart for a Kubernetes environment residing on your laptop or with a cloud provider, see xref:quickstart-helm-installs.adoc[Quick Start for Helm Chart installs].  
* If you installed Luna Streaming via the tarball package on a large server/VM or in a small HA (4 node cluster), see xref:quickstart-server-installs.adoc[Quick Start for Server/VM installs]. 

== What task can I perform in the DataStax Luna Streaming Installation Console?

From the Installation Console, you can:

* Configure the DataStax Luna Streaming environment
* View and update the DataStax Luna Streaming version and application status
* Get the host URL and generated password to launch the DataStax Luna Streaming Admin Console
* Set up and view Grafana graphs, which display metrics collected by the provided Prometheus Operator
* Analyze DataStax Luna Streaming to collect information you could provide for Support
* Sync the license that enables DataStax Luna Streaming software
* View upstream, midstream, and downstream files used by DataStax Luna Streaming

== What task can I perform in the DataStax Luna Streaming Admin Console?

From the Admin Console, you can:

* Add and run Pulsar clients
* Establish credentials for secure connections 
* Define topics that can be published for streaming apps
* Set up Pulsar sinks that publish topics and make them available to subscribers, such as for a Cassandra database table
* Control namespaces used by Pulsar
* Use the Admin API

== What is Pulsar Heartbeat?

https://github.com/datastax/pulsar-heartbeat[Pulsar Heartbeat] monitors the availability, tracks the performance, and reports failures of the Pulsar cluster. It produces synthetic workloads to measure end-to-end message pubsub latency.  Pulsar Heartbeat is a cloud-native application that can be installed by Helm within the Pulsar Kubernetes cluster.

== What is Prometheus?

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus] is an open-source tool to collect metrics on a running app, providing real-time monitoring and alerts.

== What is Grafana?

https://grafana.com/[Grafana] is a visualization tool that helps you make sense of metrics and related data coming from your apps via Prometheus, for example. 

== Pulsar Connector

=== What are the features provided by DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector (`pulsar-sink`) that are not supported in `kafka-sink`?

* Single record acknowledgement and negative acknowledgements.
* The https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/io-overview/[Pulsar IO framework] provides many features that are not possible in Kafka, and has different compression formats and auth/security features. The features are handled by Pulsar.

=== What features are missing in DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector (`pulsar-sink`) compared with `kafka-sink`?

* No support for `tinyint` (`int8bit`) and `smallint` (`int16bit`).
* The key is always a String, but you can write JSON inside it; the support is implemented in pulsar-sink, but not in Pulsar IO.
* The “value” of a “message property” is always a String; for example, you cannot map the message property to `__ttl` or to `__timestamp`.
* Field names inside structures must be valid for Avro, even in case of JSON structures. For example, field names like `Int.field` (with dot) or `int field` (with space) are not valid.

=== How is DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector distributed?

There are two packages:

* The `pulsar-sink` functionality of DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector is included with DataStax Luna Streaming. It's built in!
* You can optionally download the DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector tarball from the https://downloads.datastax.com/#pulsar-sink[DataStax Downloads] site, and then use it as its own product with your open-source Apache Pulsar install. 

If you're using open-source software (OSS) Apache Pulsar, you can use DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector with the OSS to take advantage of this `pulsar-sink` for Cassandra. See the DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector https://docs.datastax.com/en/pulsar-connector/[documentation].

== APIs

=== What client APIs does DataStax Luna Streaming provide?

The same as for Apache Pulsar. See https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries/.
